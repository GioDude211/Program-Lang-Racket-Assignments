;Objective:Write two recursive functions that calculate the mercator series to 100 terms.
;In the first version, determine the sign of each term with a named subprogram.
;The second version uses a lambda function instead of the named subprogram.
;Create a .rkt file that contains the definitions and tests the functions.

;x - x2/2 + x3/3 - x4/4 ... = ln(x+1)
